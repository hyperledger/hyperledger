- Move over to standard and clear JSON format:

All files should be of the form:

{
	"test1name":
	{
		"test1property1": ...,
		"test1property2": ...,
		...
	},
	"test2name":
	{
		"test2property1": ...,
		"test2property2": ...,
		...
	}
}

Arrays are allowed, but don't use them for sets of properties - only use them for data that is clearly a continuous contiguous sequence of values.
