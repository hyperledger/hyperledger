// MissingNodeError is returned by the trie functions (TryGet, TryUpdate, TryDelete)

// missing node and optionally a suffix that hints on which further nodes should
// also be retrieved
//
// PrefixLen is the nibble length of the key prefix that leads from the root to
// the missing node
//
// SuffixLen is the nibble length of the remaining part of the key that hints on
// which further nodes should also be retrieved (can be zero when there are no
// such hints in the error message)
