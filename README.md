# Hyperledger
Hyperledger is an open source collaborative effort created to advance cross-industry blockchain technologies. It is a global collaboration including leaders in finance, banking, Internet of Things, supply chains, manufacturing and Technology. The Linux Foundation hosts Hyperledger under the foundation.

## Why Create Hyperledger?
Not since the Web itself has a technology promised broader and more fundamental revolution than blockchain technology. A blockchain is a peer-to-peer distributed ledger forged by consensus, combined with a system for “smart contracts” and other assistive technologies. Together these can be used to build a new generation of transactional applications that establishes trust, accountability and transparency at their core, while streamlining business processes and legal constraints.
Think of it as an operating system for marketplaces, data-sharing networks, micro-currencies, and decentralized digital communities. It has the potential to vastly reduce the cost and complexity of getting things done in the real world.
Only an Open Source, collaborative software development approach can ensure the transparency, longevity, interoperability and support required to bring blockchain technologies forward to mainstream commercial adoption. That is what Hyperledger is about – communities of software developers building blockchain frameworks and platforms.

## Goals
Hyperledger has the following goals:
* Create enterprise grade, open source, distributed ledger frameworks and code bases to support business transactions

* Provide neutral, open, and community-driven infrastructure supported by technical and business governance

* Build technical communities to develop blockchain and shared ledger POCs, use cases, field trails and deployments

* Educate the public about the market opportunity for blockchain technology

* Promote our community of communities taking a toolkit approach with many platforms and frameworks

## Projects
Hyperledger incubates and promotes a [range of business blockchain technologies](http://hyperledger.org/projects), including distributed ledger frameworks, smart contract engines, client libraries, graphical interfaces, utility libraries and sample applications. The Hyperledger umbrella strategy encourages the re-use of common building blocks and enables rapid innovation of DLT components. Hyperledger's different projects progress through a standard [life cycle](https://wiki.hyperledger.org/community/project-lifecycle).
